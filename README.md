Hi There !! 
This is our very first Mern project and we are very proud about it.

## What is Filistin ?
This web application is an online 
magazine that will help to document Palestinian Cities and Villages and allow the world 
to get to know more about Palestine. We got motivated to create this magazine because of the situation that
Palestine is facing so we can show the world what is real Palestine.

## Functionality ?
The website will target two types of users, Hikers “Guests” who are looking for information about trails, and Clients “Hikes Organizers” who create hiking trips for hikers “Guests” to join. Spring  Security was used to specify the access and authorization rights for each user of the website.An external API was integrated into the website to determine the starting and ending points for each trail to provide the user with additional details about the trails.


## About us ?
