Hi There !! 
This is our very first Mern project and we are very proud about it.

# Filistin
## What is Filistin ?
This web application is an online 
magazine that will help to document Palestinian Cities and Villages and allow the world 
to get to know more about Palestine. We got motivated to create this magazine because of the situation that
Palestine is facing so we can show the world what is real Palestine.
